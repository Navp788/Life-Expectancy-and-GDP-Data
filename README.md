# Life-Expectancy-and-GDP-Data
Introduction For this project, you will act as a data researcher for the World Health Organization. You will investigate if there is a strong correlation between the economic output of a country and the life expectancy of its citizens.  During this project, you will analyze, prepare, and plot data, and seek to answer questions in a meaningful way.  After you perform analysis, you'll be creating an article with your visualizations to be featured in the fictional "Time Magazine".  Focusing Questions:  Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations? Has GDP increased over time in the six nations? Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country? What is the average life expactancy in these nations? What is the distribution of that life expectancy? GDP Source:World Banknational accounts data, and OECD National Accounts data files.  Life expectancy Data Source: World Health Organization      




An introduction to the data research

A section sharing the background info (definition of GDP for example) and sources for your data as well as any further research you conducted

An accompanying paragraph describing the following visualizations:

The violin plot of the life expectancy distribution by country
The facet grid of scatter graphs mapping GDP as a function of Life Expectancy by country
The facet grid of line graphs mapping GDP by country
The facet grid of line graphs mapping Life Expectancy by country
Any other graphs that you created in the Jupyter notebook

A conclusion touching on the limitations of the data and further research
